# Ruby Calculator TDD Homework
## Timings
45 - 90 minutes

## Tasks
Your task is to write a Ruby Calculator application that has four settings, (b)asic, (a)dvanced, (i)bmi and (t)trip

Features for each calculator:-

### Basic
Addition
Multiplication
Division
Subtraction

### Advanced:
Power
Square root

### BMI Calculator:
Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight - the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system.

### Trip Calculator
This feature asks the user for four inputs; distance, fuel efficiency (mpg), cost per gallon, speed and it will give you the time and price of your journey.

Example output: "Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost Â£255.33.""

> Note: For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative - how will you handle this?)

__Hints__  
Get user input - name = gets.chomp
Output to console - puts("Your name is #{name}")

__Deliverables__  
Must be Tested with RSpec  
Must meet DOF (Definition of Done)  
Must use Methods (DRY - Dont repeat yourself)  
Deliver code via link to pull request in Teams to  Rich and Anthony
